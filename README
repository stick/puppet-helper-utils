Tools for puppet

### check-puppet-syntax
This script will check puppet and erb syntax of either a glob of passed files or directories (will recurse) or if no options of specified recurse down the tree checking things as it goes.
It assumes that manifest files end in .pp, and everything else that is a regular file is a erb file.  This behavior is useful in that you won't accidentially embed erb in a files/foo.conf file.

### pre-commit
git pre-commit hook to run syntax checks.
This is useful for local repositories.

### pre-receive
git pre-receive hook to run syntax checks.
This is useful for remote repositories.
